# DuckGPT NextJS

This is a NextJS project which uses Typescript, Tailwind, Prisma (soon) and Ollama for text generation. Right now the project is WIP, so it's extremely messy and unfinished.

## Todo

- [x] Basic website structure
- [ ] Ollama support for generation (server-side ofc)
- [ ] Database stats (prisma, because I need to learn it)
- [ ] Rewrite so CSR is used as rarely as possible
